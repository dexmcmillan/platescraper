This project builds on the recognized Equine Assisted Learning (EAL) Program developed by Cartier Farms, which teaches life and leadership skills using horses.\n\nYouth in care experiencing mental injury / PTSD will participate weekly for 12 weeks of group training sessions delivered with horses in an arena at Venture Stables. This program is an intensive intervention consisting of a team of professionals as facilitators, hands-on work with horses, and a detailed, evidence-based curriculum that has been academically researched and shown to improve skills and wellness.\nVenture Stables Equine Assisted Learning (EAL) is a client-based program that engages people in hands-on exercises with horses to promote self-discovery, wellness, confidence and the building of communication, relationship, teamwork and problem-solving skills. The horse provides instant, honest feedback in the process, and trained, certified EAL facilitators use the detailed program curriculum to support the learning.\nVenture Stables EAL curriculum has been enhanced for this pilot by the facilitator team following earlier pilots providing the EAL program to clients with diagnosed PTSD. The results showed that through participation in Equine Assisted Learning, some clients with PTSD experienced reduced isolation, increased their self-awareness and life skills, learned how to manage triggers and symptoms, and improved their confidence and mental wellness.\nThe pilot’s research component uses evidence-based tracking tools to measure client outcomes and assess effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions.\n\n\nNeed for the project:\nThis pilot project addresses an important gap in services for Youth in care with PTSD and will increase learning about an effective intervention.\nYouth who experience mental injury / PTSD have many challenges and many barriers to living a productive life. These include being exposed to triggers and unable to handle symptoms, thus posing risk to self and others; experiencing loss of confidence and self-esteem as a result of symptoms from mental injuries; and being at home and isolated from support networks and services that might aid with healing and recovery. Without effective intervention, a cycle of deepening isolation and illness can develop, along with a decreasing capacity for living.\nAnimal Assisted Therapy, and work with horses in particular, is showing promising results in human development and wellness, yet there is a need for more research.","activity_comments":"Venture Stables is a moderately-sized equestrian facility that provides the following services:\n-Equine Therapy\n-Retreats\n-Trail Rides\n-Horse Boarding\n-Horse Training and\n-Riding Instruction Services","lobbying_focus":"Health PEI\nDepartment of Health and Wellness","other_focuses":"","focus_comments":"","funding_information":"","scrapedAt":"5/20/2021, 2:17:32 PM"},{"name":"Jayna D.
