IBC member companies provide about 90 percent of the non-government general insurance sold in Canada. As the trade association for the general insurance industry, the role of IBC is to be active in the business environment on behalf of its members, forecasting and responding to issues that may arise, and anticipating opportunities to identify, shape and influence change in support of members business needs. IBC lobbies the federal and provincial governments to secure changes in public policy and improvements in the business-operating environment that will benefit insurance companies and their customers. It works on a number of fronts to increase public understanding of home, car and business insurance. Public understanding is also fostered in five IBC regional consumer centres, where trained personnel with many years of industry and government relations experience answer tens of thousands of consumer inquiries each year.",

Our major focus involves using various multifunctional civil rights programmes to help our mostly disadvantaged, underprivileged Canadian minorities as men, women and children. Via the FAAVM multilateral humanitarian systems, and activities, we're able to reach out to these people who are very difficult to reach via more traditional-type programmes. We then use these activities to help improve the quality of life of these disadvantaged peoples, also called the visible minorities. Our all-volunteer network nationwide program is comprised of several components, all having to do with providing meaningful and positive educational, socio-cultural, spiritual, economic and overall human development activities for our mostly economically disadvantaged nationwide and worldwide. A major objective is our use of national and international legally binding humanitarian instruments, norms, precepts and principles in order to intervene at the national level to outreach visible minorities who are often very difficult to otherwise reach. We are then able to impact Canadian minorities in many positive ways. We promote early education, child welfare, gender equality, social justice, global peace and socio economic development, and promote the overall growth and advancement process. We emphasize maximizing positive human potential, drug education/prevention, healthy living, decreased street violence, improved reading and writing skills, and learning to respect others from diverse backgrounds.",

IBC member companies provide about 90 percent of the non-government general insurance sold in Canada. As the trade association for the general insurance industry, the role of IBC is to be active in the business environment on behalf of its members, forecasting and responding to issues that may arise, and anticipating opportunities to identify, shape and influence change in support of members business needs. IBC lobbies the federal and provincial governments to secure changes in public policy and improvements in the business-operating environment that will benefit insurance companies and their customers. It works on a number of fronts to increase public understanding of home, car and business insurance. Public understanding is also fostered in five IBC regional consumer centres, where trained personnel with many years of industry and government relations experience answer tens of thousands of consumer inquiries each year.",

IBC member companies provide about 90 percent of the non-government general insurance sold in Canada. As the trade association for the general insurance industry, the role of IBC is to be active in the business environment on behalf of its members, forecasting and responding to issues that may arise, and anticipating opportunities to identify, shape and influence change in support of members business needs. IBC lobbies the federal and provincial governments to secure changes in public policy and improvements in the business-operating environment that will benefit insurance companies and their customers. It works on a number of fronts to increase public understanding of home, car and business insurance. Public understanding is also fostered in five IBC regional consumer centres, where trained personnel with many years of industry and government relations experience answer tens of thousands of consumer inquiries each year.",

IBC member companies provide about 90 percent of the non-government general insurance sold in Canada. As the trade association for the general insurance industry, the role of IBC is to be active in the business environment on behalf of its members, forecasting and responding to issues that may arise, and anticipating opportunities to identify, shape and influence change in support of members business needs. IBC lobbies the federal and provincial governments to secure changes in public policy and improvements in the business-operating environment that will benefit insurance companies and their customers. It works on a number of fronts to increase public understanding of home, car and business insurance. Public understanding is also fostered in five IBC regional consumer centres, where trained personnel with many years of industry and government relations experience answer tens of thousands of consumer inquiries each year.",
